I've slept almost 12 hours, yesterday was just too much for me and I really needed to rest. We have breakfast with Robin and Pixie, today is a sad day because our paths are going to separate, it has been so nice riding together! For sure we are going to miss them!

We start riding to Nukus a bit late, but the road is fine and it should take just around an hour. Once we arrive at the hotel, we ask for the hospital; we have lunch and then we take a taxi to go there. I'm a bit nervous, I don't like doctors! When we enter there I feel overwhelmed, that's not even a little primary attention center in Spain! A lady writes my name in a sheet and I enter directly to the doctor's office, by luck we find a kind girl who helps us with the translation ... nobody here speaks a word in English.

After a quick check on my ankle (nobody looks at the knee, which today is also hurting) they decide to take an X-ray. It's just insane! They are taking X-rays in an open room! The nurse is holding my food without any protection while they take it. I don't get to see the results, someone writes something on a paper, the doctor reads it and says that I should put a bandage and take some painkillers (all of that while I'm seated on the doctor's office near an old man). They send me again to the hotel.

Well it seems it's not broken. We buy the painkillers, but I think I will skip taking them... Checking on the internet they seem to be forbidden in a lot of UE countries! I put myself a bandage and we spend the rest of the day just resting. We deserve it!
