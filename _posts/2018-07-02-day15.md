Today it's an exciting day! We are going to cross to Asia for the first time in our lives!

We are ready to leave the Just Inn hotel after the breakfast, by the way this hotel it's a great option if you want to visit Istanbul. The rooms are modest, but the staff is incredibly friendly and the location is great to explore the city center! We pack everything and the guys from the hotel help us to move the motorbike from the "parking place", they even clean the Bonnie because it has dust!

That was the parking our last days!

The traffic is not that terrible today, or maybe we are experts now, I can't say!

We reach the Intercontinental Bridge, and I have to say ... it's quite impressive! So long, and high, and the views over the Bosphorus are wonderful! However we don't like what's awaiting us in Asia, it's a super big traffic jam! We left the hotel at 12:00. We stop to have lunch at 14:00, and we are still in Istanbul!

Luckily we have the hotel in Eskişehir, not far away. It's a four hours ride through Turkey's countryside, but the views are breathtaking. There are endless wheat fields, it's like a golden sea that surrounds us!

Eskişehir surprises us a lot! It's a modern and beautiful city, lucky us! We need to buy a charger for our
electric toothbrush and we find one easily there. Until now we've lost: 1 T-shirt, 1-sock, 1-charger; if we arrive to India with our passports and the motorbike it's going to be impressive!
