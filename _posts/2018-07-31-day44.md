Today is the first time on the whole trip that we are going to travel separately. We pack everything as usual in the morning and we head to Urganch's train station to buy the ticket. Lucky us! We find a young lady that speaks English and she helps us to do it... because it's a complet chaos. I want to seat near Elias, so I show them his ticket that just make the things worst! now they think that I already have a ticket ... It takes a while, but we get the ticket that I want.

Now it's time to find a hotel for tonight for Tià here in Urganch, he takes one near the road. Tomorrow it'll be faster to take the road to Bukhara. Once he is accommodated, one of the workers from the hotel drive us to the train station.

During the day we speak with Paul and Clémence (our friends with the "little" car "@allyoucaneast), what another nice coincidence! They will arrive today to Bukhara! We'll sleep at the same hotel and they offer to give me a drive tomorrow to Samarcand!!!! I can rest the leg one more day! Those are great news!

The train should depart at 15:50, so we met one hour earlier. Elias shows up with a new friend, Martin another Austrian! It seems that I'm going to practice my German after a while! I'm a bit nervous because I don't want to leave Tià alone behind, but this is going to be an adventure!

The train is better than expected, it's a second class ticket so we have our own bed. Elias is super nice with me, he doesn't allow me to carry my bag, or even prepare my bed! The problem is that at the end we cannot seat together, but at least we are on the same wagon.

I spend the 7 hours trip on relaxing, looking the landscape, reading, hearing music and sweating, specially sweating. There is no air conditioning and I think we are over 40 degrees! The locals are also really kind with me, now and then a child shows up with some bread, fruits, sweets or "somsas" for me. Everybody knows my name!

We reach Bukhara at 23:00, we fight a bit with the taxi drivers and we head to the hotel where Paul is witing for us. We take a short walk to see Bukhara and we go to sleep. We are really tired!
