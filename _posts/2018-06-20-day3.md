Today it's going to be another "highway-day", those are not really exciting, but we need to do that. China is superfar away and we have to be there in August!

It's a really hot day again so we want to test our new toys... Tià uses for the first time the Hyperkewl vest, and I'm going to try my new Kevlar jeans.

We keep riding and riding, we eat something bad and expensive on the highway again, and around 16:00 I'm feeling sick, so I ask Tià to stop (I supose that the Hyperkewl winns the jeans when it's too hot). We stop near a gas station, and then Tià realizes that the motorbike has an oil leak... but like a big one, there is oil everywhere. Perfect, and now what we should do?! We call the insurance and they say, that we have to call the 112. A guy from the gas station helps us, and they say that in 30 minutes we get a crane. We wait 30, 40, 50... 90 minutes, and then appears our crane!

It charges the motorbike, and I realize there is not a proper place for me.. sooo I sit on an armrest, then the driver starts yelling on the phone while driving (without security belt of course). Not fun. We head to Piacenza, the nearest city with a Triumph concessionaire. We arrive to the parking where we are going to leave the motorbike for the night. Now it should come a taxi and take us to the hotel (the one the insurance is paying). An hour later the taxi is there and leave us in the Europa hotel, but when we ask for our room they say, they don't have a room reservation with our name... one hour more discussing with the insurance. At the end the crane drive told to the taxi driver the nearest hotel, not the one from the insurance. So finally, at 22:00 (6 hours later!) we have our room. We need something to eat, so we go to the kebab in front of the hotel, the sir there says goodbye saying “Guten Abend!” he thinks we are Germans!!! What a day!
