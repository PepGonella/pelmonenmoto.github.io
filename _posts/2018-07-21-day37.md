As we are not going to ride today Pixie and I take a relaxing day, our rooms have beautiful bathtubs waiting for us. Meanwhile Ti√† and Robin want to go to the center to get some things, canisters for benzine, some rope, a Go Pro support (ours is broken!). The guys had a little adventure, first they got almost attacked by an old dog, then they meet a kind guy who doesn't stops until they have all that they need (it took like 2 hours around the city, and he was driving them with the car!).

We go to eat something and we start to prepare everything for tomorrow. We are going to the desert!

We have also some time to enjoy the swimming pool and the sauna before going to bed. What a nice evening!
