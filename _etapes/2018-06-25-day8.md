We start the day with a delicious breakfast, it's a pity that we have to leave! We feel so good that we want to stay more, but new tires are waiting for us in Sofia (Bulgaria), so we have to leave. Hvala for everything!

Sorry, another highway-day... I promise that this is gonna change when we arrive to Turkey!

We arrive to Sofia too late to go to the concessionaire, so we go to the hostel. What a surprise when we see that it's like a young people hostel (they offer us a Pub Crawling tour). We are done, so we eat something fast and we go to sleep. We really need to rest, it was a looooong day!
