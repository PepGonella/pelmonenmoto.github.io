During the morning Ti√† goes to the parking to search the motorbike and to go to the mechanic with the crane. We hope that it'll be just some minor damage, and we can continue today our trip.

After a few hours (something happened between the insurance and the crane company) they take the Bonnie to the mechanic, there our friend Leo (on the phone) explains in Italian what's going on. At the end  it was just something too loose!!

We stay at the hotel until midday, so we are sure that there is no more leak and we ride to the east thorough the highway again.

Usually we don't book in advance a room, the same day at the afternoon we search something near us (as you have seen, a road trip with motorbike it's quite unpredictable). We head to a country side zone where the villages are little and charming. We stop in Nogaredo de la Torre, there is where are we going to sleep, to the B&B 23! It's an old house (in the good way) and the owners live there! We connect almost instantaneously, they are a really special couple. Paola orders for us pizza for dinner (all around us is closed at this time), and then we talk until midnight drinking some honey liquor from Slovenia! What a wonderful night!!
