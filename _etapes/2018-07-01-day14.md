Today Tià is not feeling well, so we take it easy. During the morning we visit the "Water cistern", yeah, with this name it's not so impressive, but take a look at the photos!

After that we head to the Topkapi Palace, we spend there 2 or 3 hours hanging around, and admiring it. It's a wonderful place! 

We return to the hotel at afternoon, we stay to see the match (Spain-Russia) and to rest. Tià needs to recover for tomorrow!
