Yesterday we had a strange feeling on the motorbike, we felt like a new vibration, so we decide to return to the mechanic. They receive us with a smile, and after around an hour and some tests it seems to be a combination between low pressure, and that we have to adapt to the new tires vibrations.

Today we head to Burgas, on the coast. It's the first time that we see the Black Sea, how exciting!

We reach there after some boring highway hours. Burgas it's a typical Bulgarian holidays city with its high apartment buildings.  We go to explore the Sea Garden, it's a beautiful park full of statues near the beach, after that we visit the beach (the sand is black at this part!), then we try to find a restaurant to eat something, but it's too late and everything it's closed! We are hungry so we ask at the hotel if they can make some sandwiches for us... luckily they accept!
