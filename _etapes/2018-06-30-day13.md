We stay in Istanbul until Monday, so we start our day slowly; we need it. 

Today we return to the Ayasofya and the Blue Mosque to visit both properly.  Both are just stunning, you can see it on the photos! It's a pity that we couldn't see the Blue mosque ceiling, because they where working on it and it's covered this days. 

At the afternoon we go to the Egyptian Spice basar. What a party for the senses! It's a little bit hot, and crowded, but if you are in Istanbul you have to visit it! It's full of spices (of course), sweets, perfumes, clothes... everything!

We have dinner near the hotel and we have our well deserved rest!
