We want to arrive to Tbilisi soon to visit the city, but again we are slow at the road and we reach there at afternoon. 

Today it's just another crazy day at georgian's roads with the georgian traffic. 

At evening we go to the center with the metro... what a thing!!!! it's deep as hell! We walk for a while witouht a fix "rumbo" and we end at a fast food restaurant (not any more free advertising), but first we see a freak performance on the street... a Hare Crishna group singing and dancing!!!!

We are back soon at the hotel, ad we search what to see for tomorrow.
