We want to go to check for our visa at the Uzbeck embassy, so we get up early to be the first there. Actually when we arrive there are 2 families before us. We have to wait for more than an hour until the first is called to enter. After that anything is moving. In summary, we stay there for almost 4 hours to get anything, because the aprovation mail from Uzbekistan is not there, so nobody can do anything.

We are nervous because we where said that the ship was going to departure today, so we et back to the hotel to see if the kiwis have news... and they have some. We have to phone at 17:00 again to see if it's leaving tonight. Surprise! when we phone againg they say that we try tomorrow morning at 10:00!

We decide to share a taxi (the 4 of us) and go to eat something at the center of the city, we end up at a fast food restaurant, and then we go to the promeade to have some ice-cream... it's not bad isn't it??
