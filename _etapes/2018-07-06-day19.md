Today we'll return to the Black sea! we are excited to see how it is here in Turkey. Our excitement disapears when we see it... It's like continue long city in front of the sea with its high buildings. 
We stop for a quick lunch at a village, but first we have a tea with a guy on a gas station. Then we eat the best homemade pide ever. We also go to a little shop to get soe supplies for the motorcicle, and suddenly we are surrounded by excited people. Incredible! there is a guy from Australia there, that's crazy! he had family issues on Turkey, so he has to spend here some months.

We start talking and drinking tea with the locals and Ozzie, he translates all what we need to the shop ower (a freindly guy who really wants to help us), so we get our brakes cleaned and all what we needed. Great!!!

We continue after this break until Unye, we are staying at a first line on the coast hotel. We enJoy the views from the terrace eating an ice cream... That's a good day!
