We wake up early to see the Baloons on the air over Göreme. We arrive there at almost 7, so it's a litle bit late, but we see the last ones landing. That's good enough for us. 

Today I have to take it easy, I'm not feeling still well. It's one of our "highway-days", so there is not much to explain. 

We reach Amasya at afternoon. We have our first embarrassing fall of the journey! The knew bars are working perfectly! It's just a silly situation, Tià was focused on what the GPS was saying, he tried to turn left, but it was forbidden and a taxi was coming... Tià stopped inmediately, but the floor was slipery, so we just fall slowly. Don't worry! any damage to de motorbike or to us, just on our dignity!

Amasya it's an interesting village with its old town and its beautiful houses pending in front of the river. We have a pleasant evening just walking around.
