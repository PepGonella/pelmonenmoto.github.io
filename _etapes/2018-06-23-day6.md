Today we'll cross Croatia without stopping there (we where there also in our honeymoon) to arrive to Beograd in Serbia. It's going to be another “Highway-day”, not the kind that excites us. But we want to hurry up so we can visit Beograd (first time there!) on the afternoon. 

We arrive to the hotel, and it's disappointing... it's a mess and not really clean!

We are really curious about the capital of Serbia, we don't have much time but we'll try to visit some highlights. 

The first thing that surprises us it's that it's full of life, there is young people everywhere! We can go to the center walking, so we visit the Republic square, the military museum, the Beograd fortress (the views of the city at sunset are stunning!), the Pobednik Statue, we get lost in the center (on purpose) and finally we have dinner in the Bohemian quarter like a good tourists.
