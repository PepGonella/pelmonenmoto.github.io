It's raining, but that's not going to be a pity in this house. It's just an excuse so we can stay longer and talk a little bit more with Paola. She prepares the breakfast with all the love in the world, you can taste it, it's delicious! Bruschetta, cake, some vegetables... all homemade or from the garden!

We start the ride a little bit late (again), but the good part of this trip, is that we don't have to care a lot about that!

We enter to Slovenia through Gorizia, and suddenly we see ourselves in the middle of a valley with stark winds (really?!), another time we have to stop. It's not so dangerous than in France, but it's exhausting. We decide to stop in Vipava, and that's a hit. It's a beautiful little village, and we eat well there. In the restaurant we're told that the wind should stop around 5km further, so we decide to continue, but not through the highway. We are superexposed there!

We drive some kilometers on the road, and it's way better because we are alone and the wind it's weaker here. Then we continue on the highway, we pass Ljubljana (we wanted to stop here like in our honey moon, but we need to go a little bit further!), and we stop in Å kocjan to sleep. It's a little village on the countryside, we have our own apartment there! What a luxury!
