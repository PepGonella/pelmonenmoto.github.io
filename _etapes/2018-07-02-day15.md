Today it's an exciting day! We are going to cross to Asia for the first time in our lives!

We are ready to leave the Just Inn hotel after the breakfast, by the way this hotel it's a great option if you want to visit Istanbul. The rooms are modest, but the staff is incredibly friendly and the location is great to explore the city center! We pack everything and the guys from the hotel help us to move the motorbike from the "parking place", they even clean the Bonnie because it has dust!

The traffic is not that terrible today, or maybe we are experts now, I can't say!

We reach the Intercontinental Bridge, and I have to say ... it's quite impressive! So long, and high, and the views over the Bosphorus are wonderful! However we don't like what's awaiting us in Asia, it's a super big jam! We left the hotel at 12:00. We stop to have lunch at 14:00, and we are still in Istanbul!

Luckily we have the hotel in Eski≈üehir, not far away. It's a four hours ride through Turkey's countryside, but the views are breathtaking. There are endless wheat fields, it's like a golden sea that surrounds us!
