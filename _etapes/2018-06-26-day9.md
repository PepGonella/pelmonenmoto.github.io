Today we want to change the motorbike tires, so we go to the Triumph's concessionaire. There a kind man escorts us to the mechanic, that has our tires. We are afraid that we are going to spend there the whole day, but they say that they just need one hour. 

Ti√† has to help them to remove the wheels, because we have this case-supports and it's a little bit complicated. They are friendly and they had a good English level, so we spend there a good time speaking while they work.

With the Bonnie's new shoes we go to the hotel House (we didn't want to spend another night at the hostel).

It seems that Sofia is kind of cursed for us, when we want to visit it, it starts a big storm, and it keeps raining the whole afternoon. What a pity! It's the second time we are here, and we cannot visit it properly (last year we where also here in Sofia, but we had an accident and we where both of us a little bit lame). Finally at night the rain stops, so we can go out. We see some typical dance performance in a park, and we really enjoy it; then we go to a typical restaurant, and we have dinner like kings!
