Again We go to the embassy to see what's going on with our visas. We arrive there at 10:00 and there is anybody. That's normal, if you think that the embassy is closed for the tourists today. We need our visas before the ship departs.

We end up waiting almost until 12:00, nobody is there working. The secretary says to us to try to phone later, and see if somebody can help us. It seem here everything works with phone calls!!! When we are about to leave the embassy, we meet Pixie, she was searching us to say that the ship will leave tonight. Great!!! But we'll have to leave without our sticker on the passport. We have a lazy day at the hotel until the evening, when we pack and ride to Alat.

 We arrive there at 21:00 and we meet some familiar and new faces. It seems we're going to be a log time waiting there. Some decide to camp while, but we spend the whole night speaking with other travellers. It's so exciting and interesting to hear them!
