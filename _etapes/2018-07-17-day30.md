Today we'll move to the kiwi's hotel, we miss them and it's really near to the Uzbeck embassy so we don't need to think much about it. We start the day slowly as we don't need to do anything, but then Robin write us that is possible to buy the ship tickets in Alat, so we get ready to go there.

Baku is surrounded by desert and petrol fields, and fabrics and "petroquimica"... the landscape it's not that beautiful on this side of the country. We reach Alat after an hour thanks to Robin inications, we reach the port and we are shocked. It's a port in the middle of nowhere, there is anything!!! we manage to find where to buy the tickets, and we get them. It supoused that the ship will leave tomorrow, but we have to phone to the office and they'll say.

We go directly to the hotel, and by luck we find Pixie and Robin at the hall! we talk for a while and then we go to the Old city. Two days here and we haven't visited it! It's a nice place, but a little bit too much touristic. It's full of people trying to sell something to you! We get losts in purpose, and we have a nice walk until we return to th hotel with a taxi.
