Today we are not expecting an exciting day, the highway it's waiting for us... and the views are not going to be better than yesterday. Finally I found the ""avellaners""! they have forest of them! It should have been so beautiful in the past...

We stop for a quick lunch at the road and we continue our way to Trebisonda. When we reach there it's really hot, and the drivers are really agressive with us as usual, but this time we amost have an accident. A van decided to cross just in front of us and Ti√† varely has time to break enough. i think the driver never noticed, or never cared.

Today the hotel is not that good, but clean enough. We walk around the city for a while, we buy some fruits and we return to the hotel. 

Tomorrow we'll leave Turkey!
