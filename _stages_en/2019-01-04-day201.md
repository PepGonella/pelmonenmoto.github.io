Day 201

That's it! Til here our stay in Indonesia! Thanks Indonesia! it has been intense and beautiful.

Today Maria will fly back home and we'll fly to Perth in Australia! We spend the day at "home", we pack our belongings and we head to the airport. As usual it's sad to say goosbye, I'm not good at it!

New adventures in a new continent coming folks!
