Day 188

Same as yesterday! We spend the day "working" and chilling.We also eat in the Italian restaurant. 



However, at evening I check the app in my phone (the one about earthquakes and other natural disasters) and we see that a Tsunami has occured. It has been caused by an undersea landslide that followed an eruption of Anak Krakatau in the Sunda Strait. It strikes several coastal regions of Banten in Java and Lampung in Sumatra leaving at least 426 people killed and 14,059 injured. The fact that the tsunami was triggered by a volcano rather than an earthquake meant no tsunami warning has been triggered. The coastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs before waves of up to three metres high surged in.

We love Indonesia, the landscapes, the people and the undersea life are AMAZING, but it's the first time in the whole trip that we don't feel completelly safe. All this natural disasters are quite frightening.
