Day 90

As it's a last hour decision we arrange everything with Chaman (their guide in the Spiti Valley) today; we had already everything packed to go with the motorbike and now we'll be backpackers again for a week! We have to unpack and pack our things... and we park again the motorbike at the Triumph Workshop. They are our lifesavers! We will take a car with driver to go to the Spiti Valley on the Indian Himalaya!
