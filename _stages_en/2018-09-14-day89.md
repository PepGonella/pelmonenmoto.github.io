Day 89

We are nervous, today we'll see how is the jacket. We cannot believe it, for less than 5â‚¬ it seems brand new again! the man even repaired the old "scars" from the accident in Albany! We are happy and ready to go now! Tonight we meet with Eloy and Lucy to have dinner. We exchange impressions about our last days; at the end of the supper both couples are convinced... We want to go to the mountains where they were, and they don't want to go to the cities that we visited!
