Day 100

We cannot even go and take the motorbike. It's still raining and the city is flooded everywhere. We were really lucky to leave the mountains on time because this rains had been intense and dangerous. Just on the Spiti Valley region (where we were) 22 people died, and lots had been rescued. 

Luckily we are in a nice hotel in a nice city out of danger. It's just that we finally want to move on, we want to go to Nepal and the weather doesn't allow us!
