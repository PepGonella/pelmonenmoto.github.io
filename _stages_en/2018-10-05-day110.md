Day 110

As you can imagine after the experience of yesterday we'll just don't do a lot today. We are staying in a VIP neighbourhood (we even have security guards on the way here) with great facilities, swimming pool, gym, great views upon the city... but I am the happiest person ever having ... a washing machine!!!! finally we can clean our motorbike gear! Later we go to the supermarket with our driver Ram, he will accompany us the next days wherever we need.
