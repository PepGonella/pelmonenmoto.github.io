Day 243

That's it! We'll drive the last 60km to Brisbane to return the campervan. Then, we'll visit our friend Shane (we first meet him in Osh Kirgistan, day 54 of the journey). We are excited to see him and share our experiences with another traveler. He is so kind that he allows us to stay as long as we want.

Not much to say or to show today... we end up in a traffic jam for 2 hours and then we give the van back without problems.

Finally we meet with Shane at his beautiful house, and we spend a lovely evenning there!
