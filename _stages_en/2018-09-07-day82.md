Day 82

After what happened yesterday today we are not in a good mood. We slept bad, so we decide just to stay at the hotel until the train to New Delhi departs. 

We have just another quiet train journey and a lot of time to think about what to do next on our journey... do we continue with the motorbike? or we ship it from Kathmandu to home? It seems really difficult to cross Myanmar and Thailand.
