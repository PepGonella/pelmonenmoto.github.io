Day 70

We were so tired and overwhelmed yesterday (and the temperature was not really bearable) that we spend the morning on the hotel, and in the afternoon we went to a Decathlon. We needed some more breathable clothes and two backpacks... After the little ride through India we decided to visit the other cities with train!
