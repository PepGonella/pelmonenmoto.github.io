Day 82

After what happened yesterday today we are not in a good mood. We slept bad, so we decide just to stay at the hotel until the train to New Delhi departs. 

We have just another quiet train journey and a lot of time to think about what to do next on our journey... do we continue with the motorbike? or we ship it from Kathmandu to home? It seems really difficult to cross Myanmar and Thailand.

Day 83

We want to visit what we missed the last time in Delhi, but this time we are not doing the same mistake... we will sleep in the new part of the city.

First we want to visit Akshardam, a spiritual-cultural campus (it's relatively new, from 2005), we've been told to be impressive, so there we go! It's a long way from our hotel, and when we arrive we see the big walls and signs saying that phones and cams are forbidden. When we try to enter they don't allow us. We MUST leave the phone and the camera in a crazy opened deposit and (that's the best part) under your own responsability!!! ah! but don't forget to bring your wallet so you can buy your photos on the inside... come on! we are leaving from here! I don't like this kind of spirituality.

Our next stop will be the Lotus Temple, this temple is built in the shape of a lotus flower and is the last of seven Major Bahai's temples built around the world. The lotus is a symbol common to Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Islam. People from any faith are free to visit the temple and pray or meditate, is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. While we wait to enter we are treated like soldiers; we are shouted like 100 times "STRAIGHT ONE LINEEEEE!!!", "NOW TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES!", "NO PHOTOS FROM HERE", "DON'T STAY THERE!!!", "WALK!!!"... For being a peaceful and meditation area maybe the "guardians" should be a little more quiet and educated.

To go back to the hotel we have to literally fight with the rickshaw drivers... all of them want to trick us and take us to some market. Even we have to jump from one because he was taking us somewhere where we didn't want to go! Finally after walking for a while, we find a nice rickshaw driver and we go back to our hotel. 

Day 84

Today we leave New Delhi! I have to say that we are happy to move from the cities... New Delhi it's really difficult to enjoy. This days was way to hot, and our patience was challenged every single second. It's crowded everywhere, the noise is so high that hurts your ears (to honk seems to be the national sport), the smell at some areas it's unbearable, the dirtyness everywhere, dogs with scabies fighting on the streets, people trying to trick you because you are a silly rich tourist, the silly rich tourist everywhere, the crazy traffic (there is a permanent jam!)... For sure, New Delhi is too much city for us, we belong to the land!
