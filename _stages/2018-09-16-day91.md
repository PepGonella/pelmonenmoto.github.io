Our driver comes on time, so we leave the hotel early in the morning. Today it will be a long riding day to Manali.

The first kilometers are on a highway; just easy and fast. But then, suddenly the roadworks begin and the road it's not anymore a tarmac road. Now it's just mud and stones everywhere! That plus the local way of driving makes that we need 11 hours for 300 km.

Anyway, it's nice to see how the landscape changes from rice fields, to bush forests (with monkeys on the roads) to mountain forests. We are arriving at the Himalayan!

We met Chaman in Manali, he seems a nice guide, and he knows the suroundings beause he has lived always here. We are tired, so we just have a pizza and we go to sleep.
