Day 113

Today it's my birthday (Paula)!!! Just when I wake up I have my gift, two wonderful Kashmir scarfs! They are so beautiful and soft! I'm super happy! However, as it is Monday we have things to do; we have to figure out how to continue the trip.

First of all we need to go to the two shipping companies here in Kathmandu, to negotiate the price of a motorbike shipping. However, first some reminder (sorry that's going to be long):---> First idea was to ride to Australia with the Bonnie.

---> In Azerbaijan we met Pixie and Robin from New Zealand, and they told us how difficult is to reach Australia with your own motorbike (a special company has to clean it, then quarantine, expensive shipping...). So, we started thinking about shipping the Bonnie before Australia and continue with a rented van.

---> In China we met Samuel, his first idea was like ours and he also desestimated it. Too expensive and complicated. Then, we met Mario in Pakistan, and he told us that is possible to ship the motorbike from Bali to Europe for a reasonable price. A plan is taking shape... We ride until Bali, and then, we continue as backpackers.

--> We start searching information about Myanmar and Thailand crossing (next countries after India). Here, comes the bad surprise... We need also a guide in Thailand. We knew about it in Myanmar, but we thought Thailand was easy to cross! The law is clear, NOBODY is allowed to enter with his own vehicle to the country without an official guide (it seems in other borders like Laos and Thailand, this law applies less than in the border with Myanmar). Also, we need all our papers of the motorbike translated to English by a Spanish Embassy!! That sounds complicated ... Samuel sends the motorbike from Kathmandu to Spain. We didn't know about this option, so we decided to ride to Kathmandu to ship the Bonnie also back home. This decision is the result of being completely overwhelmed in India, and due how complicated and extremely expensive is to continue through Southeastern Asia.

---> While we were in India (convinced to ship the motorbike and continue as backpakers) Javier contacts us through Instagram, he is offering a package with guide to cross Myanmar. He also says he has the way to enter to Thailand legally from Myanmar without guide. The problem is that he is not offering any warranty, and he never has done it before. Now, after some nice days riding through the jungle, and having the possibility to continue ... Our bikers eagerness starts increassing ... If we try it?? Anyway we don't have a lot of options so we start growing a group with Eloy and Lucy to cross both countries sharing the costs with other bikers. We ask for the Indian and Myanmar visa while we wait for the first group crossing results (at least we are not the first ones).

---> Already here in Nepal we find out that the crossing with Javier's company was a disaster. It seems they changed the officer on this border so the sistem that they had was not applicable. The motorbike is confiscated and retained there for a non stipulated time. That sucks. Now we are convinced to continue with the Bonnie at least until Thailand, and now it seems not duable???? The other option that we have is to cross Myanmar with a guide. Then, crossing Thailand to Laos also with a guide, and then, try to enter again to Thailand from Laos without a guide (sometimes it works, others it doesn't). We are not really into it.

---> Breaking news, last days Mario shipped the motorbike from Kathmandu to Bangkok and ... He left the airport WITHOUT a guide! He is free to ride through the country alone with his own motobike. He asked for some misterious blue paper in the Thailand Embassy here in Kathmandu and it worked. It seems this option sometimes works... others don't.

---> At this point we want to continue with the Bonnie, so we are thinking about a third option ... a legal and trouble-free one. To ship the motorbike to Kuala Lumpur. In Malaysia there is any problem to ride your own motorbike, and we even don't need a visa! That's our new plan, we'll ship the two bikes to Malaysia then, we'll ride to Thailand. Do they allow us to enter without a guide? perfect, Thailand here we go! They don't? Perfect too, we ride to Indonesia! Problem solved! If you need any information about all this mess, just write an Email to pelmonenmoto@gmail.com or a message in Instagram at @pelmonenmoto. We'll try to help you.

So, back in the present. We go to ask for the details to the shipping companies. To know the exact price is necessary to know the motorbike measures. So, they will come in the afternoon to check it.

In the evening we have a celebration dinner with Lukas (he reached Kathmandu yesterday!), Eloy and Lucy at the Steak House. Happy birthday to me!
